      <h1>About</h1>

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>

      <p>
        I am Rodrigo, a software engineer specializing in transaction processing and distributed
        systems. I have been working for MemSQL, specifically in the replication and clustering
        components, for the last three years, and learning and enjoying it a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main interests align nicely with my work - I enjoy spending time struggling with code,
        and playing with cutting edge computer technology. This actually weirds out my girlfriend,
        who often says <q>You don't know how to relax</q>. You can often find me sitting at my desk,
        staring at a dark terminal, and typing away, with the occasional loud sound of
        frustration. I also enjoy spending time with people at coffee shops, playing video games,
        and reading. You'll often find me organizing game nights at my place, where I gather many
        friends to play random games, and are mostly just a way to hang out and keep in touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goals at the moment are mostly career focused - I still have a lot to learn, and a lot of
        evolving to do. I'm looking forward to fully running some major projects at MemSQL, and
        further improving my skills in designing, and building valuable and technically interesting
        systems. Other goals are to have a corgi in my household in the not-too-far-away future.
      </p>

      <h2>What is this Website?</h2>

      <p>
        My main goal with this website is to have a place where I can publicly share write-ups of
        interesting projects I work on. It is also a way for me to explore technologies and areas I
        don't interact with often (for example, design and user interfaces). Expect to see write-ups
        about this website, and the infrastructure that serves it.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main self-imposed constraints of this website is that I am building it all from
        scratch. Could I have made my life easier if I used frameworks or templating engines?
        Certainly. Could I learn more useful skills if I used the tools professionals use to build
        web applications/websites (e.g. react, redux, ...)? Certainly. My response as to why I
        didn't use any of those? <q>I do what I want</q>. I do not intend to switch career tracks, I
        am fairly happy building systems software (the kind you would use to build a web application
        on top of), and instead I am more interested in learning the fundamentals, and the struggles
        that go into building a website/web application. In my personal experience, I have been most
        successful at doing that when I'm working in a project where I control the vast majority of
        the code. Also in the spirit of <q>I do what I want</q>, there are no guarantees I will
        completely follow this constraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        One other constraint which I intend to follow is that this website should work even if
        javascript is turned off. I do not mind javascript in websites, but I agree with the
        sentiment that most websites have gotten extremely bloated, and that the invasive ads and
        third-party tracking can be a huge issue, especially for the security and privacy conscious
        of us. This website may look a little different with javascript turned off, and may also
        lack interactive features that are not possible (or that I have not found out how) to
        implement without javascript. All functionality should be available, in particular access to
        all the content. If something does not work, feel free to e-mail me
        at <a href="mailto:rodrigo@codeblurb.com">rodrigo@codeblurb.com</a>

      <h2 id="storage">What information does this website store?</h2>

      <p>
        This website stores some information locally on visitors' computers (note: no information is
        stored if javascript isn't in use). The following is the information that is stored and its
        purpose; you can uncheck most boxes to disable storage of specific information.
      </p>

      <form>
        <fieldset disabled id="storage-preferences">
          <label><input type="checkbox" name="StorageNS"></input> Your storage preferences
          and the last time they were modified. This can not be disabled as it is used to store your
          preferences about what information to store, and to display periodic reminders to review
          this information.<br></br>

          <label><input type="checkbox" name="ThemeNS"></input> Your choice of theme. This
          information is used to persist your choice of theme for the website across page
          reloads. If this is disabled, the theme will always default to the dark theme.</label>
        </fieldset>
      </form>
